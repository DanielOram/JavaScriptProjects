#Memory-card-game: 
This is a summer project I made during Jan-Feb 2015 with the vision of making a memory card web game that can be played cross browser with multiplayer functionality. At current state the web game is functional but does not implement scoring or the multiplayer feature. 
Looking for contributors who know MeteorJS or .NET (SignalR)!
